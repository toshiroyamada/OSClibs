OSCLibs README
==============

This is a collection of [OpenSoundControl](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) (OSC) protocol command-line tools and libraries. 

Tools & Libraries
-----------------

### oscpack

`oscpack` is a printf-like library to encode OSC packets.

For example to create an OSC packet and send it via UDP:

    // UDP example
    uint8_t packet[256];
    int32_t size = oscpack(packet, "/my/address", "ifs", 123, 1.23, "msg"); 
    send(socket, packet, size, 0);

To send it via TCP, you need to encode the size of the OSC message at the
beginning of the packet.

    // TCP example
    uint8_t packet[256];
    int32_t size = oscpack(packet+4, "/my/address", "ifs", 123, 1.23, "msg");
    int32_t bit32 = htonl(size);
    memcpy(packet, &bit32, 4);
    send(socket, packet, size+4, 0);

"/my/address" is the OSC address.
"ifs" is the types of the arguments; in this case, 32-bit integer, 32-bit
floating point, and string.

Supported types are:

*   i: 32-bit integer
*   h: 64-bit integer
*   f: 32-bit floating point
*   d: 64-bit double floating point
*   s: string (array of char)	
*   c: ASCII character
*   T: True  (no argument needed)
*   F: False (no argument needed)
*   N: Nil (no argument needed)
*   I: Infinitum (no argument needed)

Unsupported types are (TODO...):

*   b: blob
*   t: timetag
*   r: 32 bit RGBA color (array of 4 32-bit integer?)
*   m: 4 byte MIDI message. Bytes from MSB to LSB are: 
    port id, status byte, data1, data2

Additionaly, `oscsize()` can be used to find out the size of the OSC packet.

### oscraw

`oscraw` is a commad-line tool to print hexidecimal values of the OSC packet.

    $ ./oscraw udp /my/address -i 123 -f 1.23 -s "this is a string"
    
    8-bit hex data is:
    2f 6d 79 2f 61 64 64 72 65 73 73 00 2c 69 66 73 
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7b 3f 9d 70 a4 74 68 69 73 
    20 69 73 20 61 20 73 74 72 69 6e 67 00 00 00 00 
    
### oscsend

`oscsend` is a command-line tool to send OSC message via TCP or UDP.

    $ ./oscsend 127.0.0.1 7374 udp /my/address -i 123 -f 1.23 -s "this is a string"

Compilation
-----------

### Using GCC

All tools and libraries use POSIX library and should compile without any
problem on *nix systems. oscpack has been ported to Windows, but others require
tweaking to get it working on Windows.

oscraw:
    cd oscraw/
    gcc -o oscraw oscraw.c
    
oscsend:
    cd oscsend/
    gcc -lm -o oscsend oscsend.c

`-lm` is need to incude the math library.

### Making a universal binary on OS X

You can pass `-arch` to gcc to specify the target architecture. On Snow Leopard,
supported targets are i386 (Intel/32bits), x86_64 (Intel/64bits), or ppc 
(PowerPC/32bits).

    gcc -lm -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -o oscsend oscsend.c
